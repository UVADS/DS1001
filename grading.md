# Grading Policy
This course uses the grading policy known as specifications grading. It has been demonstrated to provide much greater equity in the classroom and as a result improves achivement of learning objectives. However this system may be new to you. It does take some time to understand and we are ready to help you with any questions you may have. Please take advantage of office hours. For additional reading on this policy please start here [ref](https://cte.virginia.edu/blog/2020/12/04/alternative-grading-practices-support-both-equity-and-learning).

## Approach
This course does not have exams or the concept of "points". Instead there are bundles of assignments, that when completed that earn letter grades. Every individual assignment is marked as "meets spec" or "does not meet spec yet". In order to understand what "meets spec" every assignment is accompianed by a single-level rubric that outlines three things:
1. The purpose (Why am I doing this?)
2. The task (What am I going to do?)
3. The criteria (A detailed description of the necessary components of a "meets spec" submission)

The goal is to make the assignments as transparent as possible and not withold information from the students. For example in a traditional exam the students are told a list of subjects that may be on the test. The uncertainty causes anxiety and wastes an emmense ammount of time. Instead of giving exams this class provides clear instruction on tasks to perform which yield the same result (mastery of learning objectives) without the anxiety and timewasting of studying for the unknown.

## Assignment Types (duplicated in top level syllabus)
Every assignment in this class falls into one of 5 categories outlined below. Each assignment has a rubric to indicate the purpose, task, and criteria for the assignment.

The 5 assignment categories:
1. Labs - there is a lab section for this course and every student is expected to enroll and complete the lab assignments. The definintion of "lab" is loose as the assignments performed in the lab sections vary. The goal is for all of this work to be completable within the class lab period.
2. "Read" and Review - every week supplemental material will be posted to enhance the in class activities. This is not just reading but can also include watching short videos. A short review of the key points is then submitted as the assignment deliverable.
3. Case Study Extensions - During the semesters case studies will be presented. This assignment type involves going beyond the initial parameter of the case study and exploring some of the more advanced points.
4. "Look ahead" - These assignments are designed to allow students to advance their mastery of topics further. The incorperate material from course typically taken by 2nd and 3rd year students.
5. Final Essay - This assignment is the students opportunity to synthesize the semester and show mastery of the primary learning objective "define data science". The higher bundles require a more complex essay which includes a discussion of personal career paths in data science and ultimately discussing next steps and the future of data science.

## Bundles
The following table summarizes the assignmenmts required to "meet spec" to earn certain letter grades.

|Code|Assignment Type|#|Avg. Time|C|B|A|
|--|--|--|--|--|--|--|
|LABS|Labs| 12* | In class |12|12|12|
|READ|"Read" & Review|12| 1 hour | --|12|12|
|CASE|Case Study Extension|4| 6 hours | --|1|2|
|LOOK|Look Ahead|4| 6 hours | --|1|2|
|ESSY|Final Essay Parts|3| 6 hours| 1|2|3|

* There are 12 labs and all grade bundles require completion of all 12 labs. There is a make up lab day on 12/1 and any student may make up a lab that day for any reason, no excuse is necessary.
* There are 12 reading assignments and the B and A bundles require completion of all of them. This is a weekly assignment however there are more than 12 weeks in the term. The initial due date is a guideline for optimal learning alignment, these assignments can be turned in later with no excuse need. A word of caution: letting these pile up can lead to a substantial amount of work on a short time window.

## Flexibility Provisions
1. Labs: There is a make up lab week at the end of the term where students can complete a lab they were unable to complete.
2. Non-labs: For each of the non-lab assignments there are 2 more assignments given than are required for the A bundle. No assignment is essential.
3. Resubmission: After visiting office hours to discuss an assignment that "did not meet spec yet" resubmission may be allowed.
4. Final Essay: The intention is for the students to bring ideas to the professors for help developing and that comments will be given on the essay if submitted more than one week prior to the due date.
