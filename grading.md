# Grading Policy
This course uses the grading policy known as specifications grading. It has been demonstrated to provide much greater equity in the classroom and as a result improves achivement of learning objectives. However this system may be new to you. It does take some time to understand and we are ready to help you with any questions you may have. Please take advantage of office hours. For additional reading on this policy please start [here](https://teaching.virginia.edu/collections/specifications-grading).

## Approach
This course does not have exams or the concept of "points". Instead there are bundles of assignments, that when completed earn letter grades. Every individual assignment is marked as "meets spec" or "does not meet spec yet". In order to understand what "meets spec", every assignment is accompianed by a single-level rubric that outlines three things:
1. The purpose (Why am I doing this?)
2. The task (What am I going to do?)
3. The criteria (A detailed description of the necessary components of a "meets spec" submission)

The goal is to make the assignments as transparent as possible and not withold information from the students. For example in a traditional exam the students are told a list of subjects that may be on the test. The uncertainty causes anxiety and wastes an immense ammount of time. Instead of giving exams this class provides clear instruction on tasks to perform which yield the same result (mastery of learning objectives) without the anxiety and timewasting of studying for the unknown.

## Bundles
The following table summarizes the assignmenmts required to "meet spec" to earn certain letter grades.

Weekly Assignments
* LABS - There are 12 labs and all grade bundles require completion of all 12 labs. They are designed to be completed in class. There is a make up lab day and any student may make up a lab that day for any reason, no excuse is necessary.
* READ - The READ assignments are posted to Canvas a week before the due date and take less than two hours to complete. Late submissions are not accepted. Extenuating circumstances can be excused after discussion with Professor Alonzi during office hours. We suggest completion of these assignments well in advance of the deadline.

## General Assignment Description
1. Labs - there is a lab section for this course and every student is expected to enroll and complete the lab assignments. The definition of "lab" is loose as the assignments performed in the lab sections vary. The goal is for all of this work to be completable within the class lab period.
2. "Read" and Review - every week supplemental material will be posted to enhance the in class activities. This is not just reading but can also include other forms of media. The deliverable for this assignment is a short review and reflection.
3. Case Study Extensions - During the semesters case studies will be presented. This assignment type involves going beyond the initial parameter of the case study and exploring some of the more advanced points.
4. "Look ahead" - These assignments are designed to allow students to advance their mastery of topics further. They incorporate material from courses typically taken by 2nd and 3rd year students.
5. Final Essay - This assignment is the students' opportunity to synthesize the semester and show mastery of the primary learning objective "thinking like a data scientist". The higher grade bundles require a more complex essay which includes a discussion of personal career paths in data science and ultimately discussing next steps and the future of data science.

## Flexibility Provisions
1. Labs: There is a make up lab week at the end of the term where students can complete a lab they were unable to complete. No excuse is necessary.
2. Resubmission: After grading assignments marked "does not meet spec, yet" can be revised and resubmitted for full credit. For some submissions that are far off the mark an office hour visit may be necessary before resubmission is granted. A second revision is granted rarely and only after an office hour conversation.
