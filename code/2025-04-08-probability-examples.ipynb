    "This notebook takes the place of slides for the lecture on 2025-04-08 entitled \"Probability Examples\". It is a follow on to the probability sequence which started with a lecture on Probability followed by the Mastermind lab.\n",

    "Key concepts before begining:\n",
    "* Rules of probability (formally Kolmogorov axioms)\n",
    "* Fair coin example\n",
    "* Fair die example\n",
    "* Expressing results in terms of bits (aka yes/no questions)\n",
    "* The \"flat\" probability distribution (formally Discrete Uniform Distribution)\n",
    "* Entropy ( H = log2(N) )\n",
    "\n",
    "Our goal with this example is to develop an intuitive understanding of the fair coin example and extend to all values of $N$ and $p$. This will be demonstrated by simulating coin flips with a random number generator. We will conclude by comparing the simulated results to the theoretical form as well as notice the connection between infinite coin flips and the Normal Distribution.\n"
