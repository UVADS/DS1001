# Probability and Statistics Code Examples
## This readme was written by Claude

This repository contains interactive demonstrations and examples related to probability and statistics concepts.

## Files Overview

### Interactive Demonstrations

#### `variable-p-n.py`
An interactive visualization of the binomial distribution with three adjustable parameters:
- **Probability of heads (p)**: Controls the probability of success in each trial (0.0 to 1.0)
- **Number of flips (n)**: Controls the number of trials in each experiment (1 to 100)
- **Number of trials**: Controls the sample size for the simulation (1 to 10,000)

The visualization demonstrates how these parameters affect the shape of the binomial distribution and illustrates concepts like the Law of Large Numbers and the Central Limit Theorem.

#### `unfair-slider.py`
An earlier version of the binomial distribution visualization with a single slider for adjusting the probability of heads. This file demonstrates the basic concept of how changing the probability parameter affects the distribution.

### Jupyter Notebooks

#### `2025-04-08-probability-examples.ipynb`
A Jupyter notebook containing examples and explanations of probability concepts, including:
- Axioms of Probability
- Basic probability calculations
- Visualizations of probability distributions

### Images

#### `sliders.png`
A screenshot or visualization of the interactive sliders used in the demonstrations.

#### `analytics.png`
A visualization or chart related to data analytics, possibly showing statistical results or distributions.

## Usage

To run the interactive demonstrations:
1. Ensure you have Python installed with the required libraries (NumPy, Matplotlib)
2. Run the Python files directly: `python variable-p-n.py` or `python unfair-slider.py`
3. Use the sliders to adjust parameters and observe changes in the distribution

To explore the Jupyter notebook:
1. Open the notebook in Jupyter Lab or Jupyter Notebook
2. Run the cells sequentially to see the examples and explanations

## Educational Value

These examples are designed to help students understand:
- The binomial distribution and its parameters
- How sample size affects statistical distributions
- The relationship between theoretical and empirical probability
- The Central Limit Theorem through interactive exploration
