Labs Rubric - Mastermind - Entropy

DS 1001 - Spring 2023 - Professors Wright and Alonzi Due: End of lab period (or later that day) Submission format: Word doc or PDF summarizing your findings

Individual Assignment

**General Descripition:** This lab is designed to basic concept behind information gain and entropy. Mastermind is a game were through a series of questions one player tries to determine a "code" created by the another player. In doing so the value of asking questions that provide a high level of information will become paramount. 

Preparatory Assignments - None

**Why am I doing this?** In order to gain a better understanding of information gain and entropy through a hands on experience. 

**What am I going to do?** Work with a partner of group of three and alternate playing the game. At the onset of each game the codemaker should calculate the entropy of the chosen pegs for the "code". The code breaker should note the results of the game . This should include whether the code was broken or not and the number of rounds used. Try to be the codemaker and breaker at least 3 times. The codemaker should intentionally use very different types of "code", this should effect how the game is played 

**Answer these questions:**

1.  What combinations of pegs (code) seemed to be harder to break?
2.  Did your approach to asking questions change as you played?
3.  Describe where in the game information gain is being presented?

Tips for success:

-   Don't worry or even try to win, instead think about what is happening during game play
-   Work as a team with your group
-   Try to document the process used right at the start of the lab, don't wait till after you have played to start taking notes
