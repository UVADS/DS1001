# Labs Rubric - AI Fairness 360

DS 1001 - Spring 2023 - Professors Wright and Alonzi Due: End of lab period (or later that day) Submission format: Word doc or PDF summarizing your findings

Individual Assignment

**General Descripition:** This lab is designed for to get exposure to AI fairness approaches in a no code environment on the website [AI Fairness 360](https://aif360.mybluemix.net/). You will be able to work through the various fairness methods at different stages of the pipeline and reflect on which methods seem to work the best on the given datasets. 

Preparatory Assignments - None

**Why am I doing this?** In order to give you exposure to and practice with the various methods being developed and deployed in the ML fairness space. After completing the lab you'll have a better sense of how these tools are used, when they are used and how the work.  

**What am I going to do?** The AI Fairness 360 website as a demo module that includes three dataset. Work through the Demo on all three datasets and answer the questions below. 

**Answer these questions:**

1.  For each protected class variable which evaluation methods showed bias to be present?
2.  Note how each method preform at removing bias. 
3.  Was the accuracy of the model effected when using the various approaches, is so how?
4.  Given the above what are some patterns you noticed, which methods seem to work the best, where in the data process are these methods located (pre/in/post).

Tips for success:

-   Take careful notes as you go through each method
-   Have fun
