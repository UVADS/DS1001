The book is dedicated to the late Microsoft researcher Dr Jim Gray, who pioneered the idea with the catchphrase: "It's the data, stupid". The basic idea is that our capacity for collecting scientific data has far outstripped our present capacity to analyze it, and so our focus should be on developing technologies...},

  abstract = {This paper describes the use of data analytics tools for predicting the fatigue strength of steels. Several physics-based as well as data-driven approaches have been used to arrive at correlations between various properties of alloys and their compositions and manufacturing process parameters. Data-driven approaches are of significant interest to materials engineers especially in arriving at extreme value properties such as cyclic fatigue, where the current state-of-the-art physics based models have severe limitations. Unfortunately, there is limited amount of documented success in these efforts. In this paper, we explore the application of different data science techniques, including feature selection and predictive modeling, to the fatigue properties of steels, utilizing the data from the National Institute for Material Science (NIMS) public domain database, and present a systematic end-to-end framework for exploring materials informatics. Results demonstrate that several advanced data analytics techniques such as neural networks, decision trees, and multivariate polynomial regression can achieve significant improvement in the prediction accuracy over previous efforts, with R2 values over 0.97. The results have successfully demonstrated the utility of such data mining tools for ranking the composition and process parameters in the order of their potential for predicting fatigue strength of steels, and actually develop predictive models for the same.},

In this article, we look at how data-driven techniques are playing a big role in deciphering processing-structure-property-performance relationships in materials, with illustrative examples of both forward models (property prediction) and inverse models (materials discovery). Such analytics can significantly reduce time-to-insight and accelerate cost-effective materials discovery, which is the goal of MGI.},

It turned from referring to a problem and an opportunity for organizations with very large data sets to being the talisman for an emerging economic and cultural order that is both celebrated and feared for its deep and pervasive effects on the human condition. Economically, the phrase now denotes a data-mediated form of commerce exemplified by Google. Culturally, the phrase stands for a new form of knowledge and knowledge production. In this essay, we explore the connection between these two implicit meanings, considered as dimensions of a real social and scientific transformation with observable properties. We develop three central concepts: the datasphere, thick mediation, and representational opacity. These concepts provide a theoretical framework for making sense of how the economic and cultural dimensions interact to produce a set of effects, problems, and opportunities, not all of which have been addressed by big data's critics and advocates.{$<$}/p{$>$}},

A new idea excites people, exaggerated claims are made (and often believed), and the idea takes on bigger-than-life proportions. Eventually, however, reality sets in, and a critical backlash begins. There is a strong tendency to take the criticism seriously, much more than the initial hype. However, just as the goodness of the original idea ballooned wildly during the boom, the critique gets overstated significantly during the bust. The clear-eyed observer will avoid getting taken in by either of these sides of the hype cycle and move quickly to the ``plateau of productivity,'' but it is hard to see through the smoke and mirrors.},

In addition the notions reference language, publication language, and hardware representations are explained.In the first chapter a survey of the basic constituents and features of the language is given, and the formal notation, by which the syntactic structure is defined, is explained.The second chapter lists all the basic symbols, and the syntactic units know as identifiers, numbers, and strings are defined. Further, some important notions such as quantity and value are defined.The third chapter explains the rules for forming expressions, and the means of these expressions. Three different types of expressions exist: arithmetic, Boolean (logical), and designational.The fourth chapter describes the operational units of the language, known and statements. The basic statements are: assignment statements (evaluation of a formula), go to statements (explicit break of the sequence of execution of statements), dummy statements, and procedure statements (call for execution of a closed process, defined by a procedure declaration). The formation of more complex structures, having statement character, is explained. Thes include: conditional statements, for statements, compound statements, and blocks.In the fifth chapter the units known as declarations, serving for defining permanent properties of the units entering into a process described in the language, are defined.The report ends with two detailed examples of the use of the language, and an alphabetic index of definitions.},

  abstract = {Data science is an emerging interdisciplinary field that combines elements of mathematics, statistics, computer science, and knowledge in a particular application domain for the purpose of extracting meaningful information from the increasingly sophisticated array of data available in many settings. These data tend to be non-traditional, in the sense that they are often live, large, complex, and/or messy. A first course in statistics at the undergraduate level typically introduces students with a variety of techniques to analyze small, neat, and clean data sets. However, whether they pursue more formal training in statistics or not, many of these students will end up working with data that is considerably more complex, and will need facility with statistical computing techniques. More importantly, these students require a framework for thinking structurally about data. We describe an undergraduate course in a liberal arts environment that provides students with the tools necessary to apply data science. The course emphasizes modern, practical, and useful skills that cover the full data analysis spectrum, from asking an interesting question to acquiring, managing, manipulating, processing, querying, analyzing, and visualizing data, as well communicating findings in written, graphical, and oral forms.},

  abstract = {Frequently a researcher is interested in a theoretical distribution or characteristics of that distribution, such as its mean, standard deviation, or 2.5 and 97.5 percentiles. One hundred or even 50 years ago, we were restricted practically by computing limitations to theoretical distributions that are described by an explicit equation, such as the binomial or multivariate normal distribution. Using mathematical models of distributions often requires considerable mathematical ability, and also imposes rather severe and often intractable assumptions on the applied researchers (e.g., normality, independence, variance assumptions, and so on). But computer simulations now provide more flexibility specifying distributions, which in turn provide more flexibility specifying models. One contemporary simulation technique is Markov chain Monte Carlo (MCMC) simulation, which can specify arbitrarily complex and nested multivariate distributions. It can even combine different theoretical families of variates. Another contemporary technique is the bootstrap, which can construct sampling distributions of conventional statistics that are free from most (but not all) assumptions. It can even create sampling distributions for new or exotic test statistics that the researcher created for a specific experiment},

Informaticology escapes from the limitations of instrumental objectives and the perspective of usage that both restrict the scope of informatics. That is achieved by including fiction science in informaticology and by ranking fiction science on equal terms with computer science and data science, and framing (the study of) game design, evelopment, assessment and distribution, ranging from serious gaming to entertainment gaming, as a chapter of fiction science. A suggestion for the scope of fiction science is specified in some detail. In order to illustrate the coherence of informaticology thus conceived, a potential application of fiction to the ontology of instruction sequences and to software quality assessment is sketched, thereby highlighting a possible role of fiction (science) within informaticology but outside gaming.},

Hart's use of the term was quite different, and his work has been misunderstood because those differences were underestimated. Hart should not be read as basing his argument for judicial discretion on the nature of language; primarily, he was putting forward a policy argument for why rules should be applied in a way which would require that discretion.},

This expansion is coupled to the exponential data deluge from multiple sky surveys, which have grown from gigabytes into terabytes during the past decade, and will grow from terabytes into Petabytes (even hundreds of Petabytes) in the next decade. With this increased vastness of information, there is a growing gap between our awareness of that information and our understanding of it. Training the next generation in the fine art of deriving intelligent understanding from data is needed for the success of sciences, communities, projects, agencies, businesses, and economies. This is true for both specialists (scientists) and non-specialists (everyone else: the public, educators and students, workforce). Specialists must learn and apply new data science research techniques in order to advance our understanding of the Universe. Non-specialists require information literacy skills as productive members of the 21st century workforce, integrating foundational skills for lifelong learning in a world increasingly dominated by data. We address the impact of the emerging discipline of data science on astronomy education within two contexts: formal education and lifelong learners.},

Along with these changes in society, powerful new data science methods support research using administrative, internet, textual, and sensor-audio-video data. Burgeoning data and innovative methods facilitate answering previously hard-to-tackle questions about society by offering new ways to form concepts from data, to do descriptive inference, to make causal inferences, and to generate predictions. They also pose challenges as social scientists must grasp the meaning of concepts and predictions generated by convoluted algorithms, weigh the relative value of prediction versus causal inference, and cope with ethical challenges as their methods, such as algorithms for mobilizing voters or determining bail, are adopted by policy makers.},

We propose a procedure for this purpose which is based on a data-directed partitioning of the space into subregions and a fitting of the function in each subregion. The behavior of the procedure is heuristically discussed and illustrated by some simulation examples.},

The other uses algorithmic models and treats the data mechanism as unknown. The statistical community has been committed to the almost exclusive use of data models. This commitment has led to irrelevant theory, questionable conclusions, and has kept statisticians from working on a large range of interesting current problems. Algorithmic modeling, both in theory and practice, has developed rapidly in fields outside statistics. It can be used both on large complex data sets and as a more accurate and informative alternative to data modeling on smaller data sets. If our goal as a field is to use data to solve problems, then we need to move away from exclusive dependence on data models and adopt a more diverse set of tools.

Digital technologies\textemdash with hardware, software, and networks at their core\textemdash will in the near future diagnose diseases more accurately than doctors can, apply enormous data sets to transform retailing, and accomplish many tasks once considered uniquely human. In The Second Machine Age MIT's Erik Brynjolfsson and Andrew McAfee\textemdash two thinkers at the forefront of their field\textemdash reveal the forces driving the reinvention of our lives and our economy. As the full impact of digital technologies is felt, we will realize immense bounty in the form of dazzling personal technology, advanced infrastructure, and near-boundless access to the cultural Items that enrich our lives. Amid this bounty will also be wrenching change. Professions of aii kinds\textemdash from lawyers to truck drivers\textemdash will be forever upended. Companies will be forced to transform or die. Recent economic indicators reflect this shift: fewer people are working, and wages are failing even as productivity and profits soar. Drawing on years of research and up-to-the-minute trends, Brynjolfsson and McAfee identify the best strategies for survival and offer a new path to prosperity. These include revamping education so that it prepares people for the next economy instead of the last one, designing new collaborations that pair brute processing power with human ingenuity, and embracing policies that make sense in a radically transformed landscape. A fundamentally optimistic book, The Second Machine Age will alter how we think about Issues of technological, societal, and economic progress.

He obtained a diploma in mathematics in 1958 and a Ph.D. in mathematics in 1961, both from ETH Zurich. His thesis was in pure mathematics, but he then decided to go into statistics. He spent 1961--1963 as a postdoc at the statistics department in Berkeley where he wrote his first and most famous paper on robust statistics, ``Robust Estimation of a Location Parameter.'' After a position as a visiting professor at Cornell University, he became a full professor at ETH Zurich. He worked at ETH until 1978, interspersed by visiting positions at Cornell, Yale, Princeton and Harvard. After leaving ETH, he held professor positions at Harvard University 1978--1988, at MIT 1988--1992, and finally at the University of Bayreuth from 1992 until his retirement in 1999. He now lives in Klosters, a village in the Grisons in the Swiss Alps. Peter Huber has published four books and over 70 papers on statistics and data analysis. In addition, he has written more than a dozen papers and two books on Babylonian mathematics, astronomy and history. In 1972, he delivered the Wald lectures. He is a fellow of the IMS, of the American Association for the Advancement of Science, and of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences. In 1988 he received a Humboldt Award and in 1994 an honorary doctorate from the University of Neuch\textbackslash\^\{a\}tel. In addition to his fundamental results in robust statistics, Peter Huber made important contributions to computational statistics, strategies in data analysis, and applications of statistics in fields such as crystallography, EEGs, and human growth curves.},

Data science, however, is often understood as a broader, task-driven and computationally-oriented version of statistics. Both the term data science and the broader idea it conveys have origins in statistics and are a reaction to a narrower view of data analysis. Expanding upon the views of a number of statisticians, this paper encourages a big-tent view of data analysis. We examine how evolving approaches to modern data analysis relate to the existing discipline of statistics (e.g. exploratory analysis, machine learning, reproducibility, computation, communication and the role of theory). Finally, we discuss what these trends mean for the future of statistics by highlighting promising directions for communication, education and research.},

Despite the recent sensational declaration of a data scientist as ``the sexiest job of the 21st century'', however, there is a lack of published rigorous studies of what a data scientist is, and what job skills this hottest job title may require. In order to address this gap, we systematically examine relevant source material to extract key definitions and categorize them towards understanding emergent roles and skills of data scientists. We conclude that the current lack of clear skills specifications and the growing skills shortage are key barriers to realizing the potential benefits of big data in organizations, through hiring data scientists and leveraging their game changer roles, indicating important educational implications for our IS field.},

  abstract = {Good economic mechanisms depend on the preferences of participants in the mechanism. For example, the revenue-optimal auction for selling an item is parameterized by a reserve price, and the appropriate reserve price depends on how much the bidders are willing to pay. A mechanism designer can potentially learn about the participants' preferences by observing historical data from the mechanism; the designer could then update the mechanism in response to learned preferences to improve its performance. The challenge of such an approach is that the data corresponds to the actions of the participants and not their preferences. Preferences can potentially be inferred from actions but the degree of inference possible depends on the mechanism. In the optimal auction example, it is impossible to learn anything about preferences of bidders who are not willing to pay the reserve price. These bidders will not cast bids in the auction and, from historical bid data, the auctioneer could never learn that lowering the reserve price would give a higher revenue (even if it would). To address this impossibility, the auctioneer could sacrifice revenue optimality in the initial auction to obtain better inference properties so that the auction's parameters can be adapted to changing preferences in the future. This paper develops the theory for optimal mechanism design subject to good inferability.},

It was gratifying to see how well the groups of theoretical statisti cians, software developers and applied research workers were represented, whose mixing is an event made uniquely possible by this symposium. While maintaining traditions certain new features have been introduced at this con ference: there were a larger number of invited speakers; there was more commercial sponsorship and exhibition space; and a larger body of proceedings have been published. The structure of the proceedings follows a standard format: the papers have been grouped together according to a rough subject matter classification, and within topic follow an approximate aphabetical order. The papers are published in two volumes ac cording to the emphasis of the topics: volume I gives a slight leaning towards statistics and modelling, while volume II is focussed more on computation; but this is certainly only a crude distinction and the volumes have to be thought of as the result of a single en terprise.},

Computational requi rements may be limiting in (I) and (ill), either through the need for special programming effort, or because of the difficulties of initial data management or because of the load of detailed analysis. The implications of modern computational developments for statistical work can be illustrated in the context of the study of specific probabilistic models, the development of general statistical theory, the design of investigations and the analysis of empirical data. While simulation is usually likely to be the most sensible way of investigating specific complex stochastic models, computerized algebra has an obvious role in the more analyti cal work. It seems likely that statistics and applied probability have made insufficient use of developments in numerical analysis associated more with classical applied mathematics, in particular in the solution of large systems of ordinary and partial differential equations, integral equations and integra-differential equations and for the \textcent raction of "useful" in formation from integral transforms. Increasing emphasis on models incorporating specific subject-matter considerations is one route to bridging the gap between statistical ana.},

  abstract = {Commercial air travel is a key global industry facilitating the complex daily movements of planes, people, goods, and services across the world. In this paper we analyse contemporary air travel through the conceptualisation of a culture of real virtuality. We contend that air travel now consists of passage through 'code/space'. Such code/space includes travel websites, check-in, security checkpoints, flight decks, air-traffic control, immigration, and customs checkpoints, which together form assemblages that define the practices and experiences of air travel. Code/space is qualitatively different to coded space, in which software influences the production of space, in that code and space are mutually constituted -- produced through one another. This mutual constitution is dyadic so that if either the code or space 'fail', the production of space 'fails'. Our formulation of code/space is nondeterministic and nonuniversal, and how code/space operates and is experienced is embodied through the performances and interactions of the people within the space (between people, and between people and code). In this sense, code/space is constantly in a state of becoming. We illustrate the nature of code/space, and the discursive regimes that support its production, and demonstrate how the code/spaces of an air travel are simultaneously local and global and induce Castells' notions of 'space of flows' and 'timeless time'.},

  abstract = {More than 50 years ago, John Tukey called for a reformation of academic statistics. In ``The Future of Data Analysis,'' he pointed to the existence of an as-yet unrecognized science, whose subject of interest was learning from data, or ``data analysis.'' Ten to 20 years ago, John Chambers, Jeff Wu, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman independently once again urged academic statistics to expand its boundaries beyond the classical domain of theoretical statistics; Chambers called for more emphasis on data preparation and presentation rather than statistical modeling; and Breiman called for emphasis on prediction rather than inference. Cleveland and Wu even suggested the catchy name ``data science'' for this envisioned field. A recent and growing phenomenon has been the emergence of ``data science'' programs at major universities, including UC Berkeley, NYU, MIT, and most prominently, the University of Michigan, which in September 2015 announced a \$100M ``Data Science Initiative'' that aims to hire 35 new faculty. Teaching in these new programs has significant overlap in curricular subject matter with traditional statistics courses; yet many academic statisticians perceive the new programs as ``cultural appropriation.'' This article reviews some ingredients of the current ``data science moment,'' including recent commentary about data science in the popular media, and about how/whether data science is really different from statistics. The now-contemplated field of data science amounts to a superset of the fields of statistics and machine learning, which adds some technology for ``scaling up'' to ``big data.'' This chosen superset is motivated by commercial rather than intellectual developments. Choosing in this way is likely to miss out on the really important intellectual event of the next 50 years. Because all of science itself will soon become data that can be mined, the imminent revolution in data science is not about mere ``scaling up,'' but instead the emergence of scientific studies of data analysis science-wide. In the future, we will be able to predict how a proposal to change data analysis workflows would impact the validity of data analysis across all of science, even predicting the impacts field-by-field. Drawing on work by Tukey, Cleveland, Chambers, and Breiman, I present a vision of data science based on the activities of people who are ``learning from data,'' and I describe an academic field dedicated to improving that activity in an evidence-based manner. This new field is a better academic enlargement of statistics and machine learning than today's data science initiatives, while being able to accommodate the same short-term goals. Based on a presentation at the Tukey Centennial Workshop, Princeton, NJ, September 18, 2015.},

Yet anthropologists have been cautious in taking data itself as their object, even as the social life of data practices becomes manifest in our ethnographies.

  abstract = {The Closed World offers a radically new alternative to the canonical histories of computers and cognitive science. Arguing that we can make sense of computers as tools only when we simultaneously grasp their roles as metaphors and political icons, Paul Edwards shows how Cold War social and cultural contexts shaped emerging computer technology\rule{1em}{1pt}and were transformed, in turn, by information machines.The Closed World explores three apparently disparate histories\rule{1em}{1pt}the history of American global power, the history of computing machines, and the history of subjectivity in science and culture\rule{1em}{1pt}through the lens of the American political imagination. In the process, it reveals intimate links between the military projects of the Cold War, the evolution of digital computers, and the origins of cybernetics, cognitive psychology, and artificial intelligence.Edwards begins by describing the emergence of a "closed-world discourse" of global surveillance and control through high-technology military power. The Cold War political goal of "containment" led to the SAGE continental air defense system, Rand Corporation studies of nuclear strategy, and the advanced technologies of the Vietnam War. These and other centralized, computerized military command and control projects\rule{1em}{1pt}for containing world-scale conflicts\rule{1em}{1pt}helped closed-world discourse dominate Cold War political decisions. Their apotheosis was the Reagan-era plan for a "Star Wars" space-based ballistic missile defense.Edwards then shows how these military projects helped computers become axial metaphors in psychological theory. Analyzing the Macy Conferences on cybernetics, the Harvard Psycho-Acoustic Laboratory, and the early history of artificial intelligence, he describes the formation of a "cyborg discourse." By constructing both human minds and artificial intelligences as information machines, cyborg discourse assisted in integrating people into the hyper-complex technological systems of the closed world.Finally, Edwards explores the cyborg as political identity in science fiction\rule{1em}{1pt}from the disembodied, panoptic AI of 2001: A Space Odyssey, to the mechanical robots of Star Wars and the engineered biological androids of Blade Runner\rule{1em}{1pt}where Information Age culture and subjectivity were both reflected and constructed.Inside Technology series},

  abstract = {Data science is a new academic field that has received much attention in recent years. One reason for this is that our increasingly digitalized society generates more and more data in all areas of our lives and science and we are desperately seeking for solutions to deal with this problem. In this paper, we investigate the academic roots of data science. We are using data of scientists and their citations from Google Scholar, who have an interest in data science, to perform a quantitative analysis of the data science community. Furthermore, for decomposing the data science community into its major defining factors corresponding to the most important research fields, we introduce a statistical regression model that is fully automatic and robust with respect to a subsampling of the data. This statistical model allows us to define the `importance' of a field as its predictive abilities. Overall, our method provides an objective answer to the question `What is data science?'.},

Methods were developed to calculate eye velocity and eye acceleration in real-time from an electronystag-mogram (ENG) signal that was recorded using a one-pole RC high-pass filter in the preamplifier. Nonrecursive, finite impulse-response digital filters were designed to remove the effects of the RC high-pass filter and calculate the first and second time derivatives of the ENG signal, as well as remove high-frequency noise. Applying these new techniques to the analysis of vestibular nystagmus enables estimation of the transfer characteristics of the vestibuloocular system.},

In general it was found that the rate of learning was related to the difference between initial response probability and probability of reinforcement during a series. It was also noted that Ss did not respond to a series as a whole, but that sensitivity to the effects of reinforcements and nonreinforcements increased as a function of trials.

Laws of the theory state probability relations between momentary changes in behavioral and environmental variables. From this point of view it has been possible to derive simple relations between probability of response and several commonly used measures of learning, and to develop mathematical expressions describing learning in both classical conditioning and instrumental learning situations under simplified conditions."

This article is the first in a series authored by Initiative for Analytics and Data Science Standards (IADSS). We review the history of data science, which we trace back to 1974, and the emergence of data science as a profession in the industry, followed by a classification of knowledge and skills commonly associated with data science professionals, pointing to a lack of detailed and consistent treatment of the topic. We then present a Data Science Knowledge Framework, that we believe can support industry standardization and building measurement and assessment methodologies for data science professionals.},

In an attempt to gain better understanding of data, fields such as information visualization, data mining and graphic design are employed, each solving an isolated part of the specific problem, but failing in a broader sense: there are too many unsolved problems in the visualization of complex data. As a solution, this dissertation proposes that the individual fields be brought together as part of a singular process titled Computational Information Design. This dissertation first examines the individual pedagogies of design, information, and computation with a focus on how they support one another as parts of a combined methodology for the exploration, analysis, and representation of complex data. Next, in order to make the process accessible to a wider audience, a tool is introduced to simplify the computational process for beginners, and can be used as a sketch- ing platform by more advanced users. Finally, a series of examples show how the methodology and tool can be used to address a range of data problems, in particular, the human genome.},

These can be expressed in terms of the systemized framework that formed the basis of mediaeval education - the trivium (logic, grammar, and rhetoric) and quadrivium (arithmetic, geometry, music, and astronomy). However, rather than focusing on number, data is the new keystone. We need to understand what rules it obeys, how it is symbolized and communicated and what its relationship to physical space and time is. In this paper, we will review this understanding in terms of the technologies and processes that it requires. We contend that, at least, an appreciation of all these aspects is crucial to enable us to extract scientific information and knowledge from the data sets which threaten to engulf and overwhelm us.},

It's not just sexy: For millions of managers, analysts, and students who need to solve real business problems, it's indispensable. Unfortunately, there's been nothing easy about learning data science\textendash until now.  Getting Started with Data Science takes its inspiration from worldwide best-sellers like Freakonomics and Malcolm Gladwell's Outliers: It teaches through a powerful narrative packed with unforgettable stories. Murtaza Haider offers informative, jargon-free coverage of basic theory and technique, backed with plenty of vivid examples and hands-on practice opportunities. Everything's software and platform agnostic, so you can learn data science whether you work with R, Stata, SPSS, or SAS. Best of all, Haider teaches a crucial skillset most data science books ignore: how to tell powerful stories using graphics and tables. Every chapter is built around real research challenges, so you'll always know why you're doing what you're doing. You'll master data science by answering fascinating questions, such as:\textbullet{} Are religious individuals more or less likely to have extramarital affairs?\textbullet{} Do attractive professors get better teaching evaluations?\textbullet{} Does the higher price of cigarettes deter smoking?\textbullet{} What determines housing prices more: lot size or the number of bedrooms?\textbullet{} How do teenagers and older people differ in the way they use social media?\textbullet{} Who is more likely to use online dating services?\textbullet{} Why do some purchase iPhones and others Blackberry devices?\textbullet{} Does the presence of children influence a family's spending on alcohol? For each problem, you'll walk through defining your question and the answers you'll need; exploring howothers have approached similar challenges; selecting your data and methods; generating your statistics;organizing your report; and telling your story. Throughout, the focus is squarely on what matters most:transforming data into insights that are clear, accurate, and can be acted upon.},

In these positions, they are expected to understand how to utilize databases and other data warehouses, scrape data from Internet sources, program solutions to complex problems in multiple languages, and think algorithmically as well as statistically. These data science topics have not traditionally been a major component of undergraduate programs in statistics. Consequently, a curricular shift is needed to address additional learning outcomes. The goal of this paper is to motivate the importance of data science proficiency and to provide examples and resources for instructors to implement data science in their own statistics curricula. We provide case studies from seven institutions. These varied approaches to teaching data science demonstrate curricular innovations to address new needs. Also included here are examples of assignments designed for courses that foster engagement of undergraduates with data and data science.},

  abstract = {This book presents the papers delivered at the Conference on Systems and Computer Science held at the University of Western Ontario in September 1965. The primary purposes of the Conference were the promotion of research and the development of the teaching of computer science in Canadian universities. The papers focus attention on some of the concepts of Computer Science as a new field of study and at the same time provide a background for scientists looking at the subject for the first time. The chief developments in computer science have been concerned with the "applied" rather than the "pure" areas of the field: numerical analysis, applied statistics and operations research, and data processing. But there is something more to computers than the physical components and this book represents an attempt to correct the imbalance between "applied" and "pure" by drawing attention to certain theoretical aspects of computer and information science. Among the topics discussed are the theory of finite and infinite automata, aspects of formal language theory, heuristic and non-heuristic approaches to theorem proving and the mathematical formulation of the theory of general systems. There are also references to the problems of machine design, to software systems including higher-level languages, to multiple control computer models and to applied systems. This collection of papers will appeal first to graduate students and professors in Computer Science. It will also be of interest to computer scientists in industry and in government and university research groups and to the scientific public interested in discovering some of the principal ingredients and directions of the computer and information sciences.},

  abstract = {"During the past decade there has been an explosion in computation and information technology. With it have come vast amounts of data in a variety of fields such as medicine, biology, finance, and marketing. The challenge of understanding these data has led to the development of new tools in the field of statistics, and spawned new areas such as data mining, machine learning, and bioinformatics. Many of these tools have common underpinnings but are often expressed with different terminology. This book describes the important ideas in these areas in a common conceptual framework. While the approach is statistical, the emphasis is on concepts rather than mathematics. Many examples are given, with a liberal use of color graphics. It is a valuable resource for statisticians and anyone interested in data mining in science or industry. The book's coverage is broad, from supervised learning (prediction) to unsupervised learning. The many topics include neural networks, support vector machines, classification trees and boosting---the first comprehensive treatment of this topic in any book. This major new edition features many topics not covered in the original, including graphical models, random forests, ensemble methods, least angle regression and path algorithms for the lasso, non-negative matrix factorization, and spectral clustering. There is also a chapter on methods for "wide'' data (p bigger than n), including multiple testing and false discovery rates."--Publisher's description.},

This conceptualization is illustrated through analysis of an episode of negotiated order accessed through an organization development intervention; a meeting of senior managers of Systech, a major IT organization, to decide on a new business model. This perspective helps to respond to some of the key challenges facing the organizational discourse field in terms of developing more clearly specified conceptualizations of discourse suited to the organizational level of analysis, achieving a more holistic and discourse-sensitive understanding of empirical contexts by organizational researchers, and illustrating that organizational discourse analysis is not simply an intellectual luxury but can have pragmatic, relevant implications.},

They include things like designing scientific studies in a team-oriented environment, ensuring protocol compliance, ensuring data quality, managing the storage/transmission/retrieval of data, and providing descriptive and graphical analyses of data. To bring greater purpose and practicality to programs for the undergraduate statistics major, it will be necessary to give greater prominence to nonmathematical statistics.

Why should one study data analysis? How should it be taught? What techniques work best, and for whom? How valid are the results? How much data should be tested? Which machine languages should be used, if used at all? Emphasis on apprenticeship (through hands-on case studies) and anecdotes (through real-life applications) are the tools that Peter J. Huber uses in this volume. Concern with specific statistical techniques is not of immediate value; rather, questions of strategy \textendash{} when to use which technique \textendash{} are employed. Central to the discussion is an understanding of the significance of massive (or robust) data sets, the implementation of languages, and the use of models. Each is sprinkled with an ample number of examples and case studies. Personal practices, various pitfalls, and existing controversies are presented when applicable. The book serves as an excellent philosophical and historical companion to any present-day text in data analysis, robust statistics, data mining, statistical learning, or computational statistics.},

Due to its scope, this research should take the form of broad international cooperation based on a reasonably common research framework, one close in spirit to that of Ives, Hamilton and Davis. A research framework of this kind should include as one element a profound conceptual model for IS design as a process, an area which is left relatively unanalyzed in the model of Ives et al. For that purpose the paper outlines a framework based on the sociocybernetic metamodel for IS design as a starting point for discussion and hopefully a more elaborate framework.},

  abstract = {In this paper four alternative quarterly econometric models of investment behavior are fitted to a common set of data for individual manufacturing industries in the United States. Goodness of fit and absence of autocorrelation of errors are used as a basis for comparison of the performance of the alternative models. The econometric models are compared with each other and with alternative explanations of data on investment based on surveys of anticipated investment and on mechanical forecasting schemes. The four econometric models included in our study are those of Anderson [2], Eisner [15], Jorgenson and Stephenson [38], and Meyer and Glauber [46]. On the basis of our comparison, the ranking of the alternative models is as follows: (1) Jorgenson-Stephenson, (2) Eisner, (3) Meyer-Glauber, (4) Anderson. Anticipatory data give a better fit to data on investment expenditures than that provided by any of the econometric models. Mechanical forecasting schemes provide a fit that is superior to the Anderson and Meyer-Glauber models. These schemes are slightly inferior to the Eisner model and clearly inferior to the Jorgenson-Stephenson model. The alternative econometric models included in our comparison differ in specification of the time structure of the investment process and in the role ascribed to specific determinants of investment behavior. Both aspects of an econometric model affect its performance so that it is difficult to discriminate among alternative determinants of investment behavior on the basis of our results.},

  abstract = {In this paper four alternative quarterly econometric models of investment behavior are compared with regard to predictive performance. Predictive performance may be assessed in two ways: (i) We compare prediction errors for a period of prediction with errors for a period of fit. (ii) We fit investment functions for both periods and test for structural change. These two procedures may be viewed as alternative tests of the hypothesis of structural change; the second is more powerful from the statistical point of view. Test of predictive performance supplement the comparisons of alternative models given in our preceding paper [17]. Goodness of fit may be exaggerated by consideration of a wide range of alternatives and selection of the one that fits best. If goodness of fit is exaggerated, a predictive test should produce evidence of structural change between the period of fit and the period of prediction. Of course, the better an econometric model fits the data, the more stringent this criterion for predictive performance. The econometric models included in our study are those of Anderson [1], Eisner [7], Jorgenson and Stephenson [19], and Meyer and Glauber [21]. On the basis of predictive performance the ranking of the alternative models is as follows: (1) Eisner, (2) Jorgenson-Stephenson, (3) Meyer-Glauber, and (4) Anderson. This ranking is similar to that resulting from comparisons based on goodness of it presented in our preceding paper [17]. For econometric models of quarterly investment behavior, the models that fit the best also have the best predictive performance.},

The purpose of this paper is to put on record the role and organisation of OR in RAF Fighter Command over the divide of the Battle of Britain in 1940. Based upon hitherto unpublished sources, the paper offers insights into wartime perceptions of the role of OR in terms of its remit and organisation. In this respect, it serves as an essential complement to Patrick Blackett's wartime commentaries on the ideal functions of OR and its status within the military hierarchy.},

Such a simulation is flexible enough to optimize and evaluate a large range of parameters. On three separate passes through the 704 (with tape storage of intermediate results) the program simulates radar, target, and missile performance, as well as SAGE tracking and missile guidance. A fourth program presents the desired output data in the form of frequency distributions and detailed results pertaining to selected target or missile tracks.},

  abstract = {Few companies in history have ever been as successful and as admired as Google, the company that has transformed the Internet and become an indispensable part of our lives. How has Google done it? Veteran technology reporter Steven Levy was granted unprecedented access to the company, and in this revelatory book he takes readers inside Google headquarters \textemdash{} the Googleplex \textemdash{} to show how Google works. While they were still students at Stanford, Google cofounders Larry Page and Sergey Brin revolutionized Internet search. They followed this brilliant innovation with another, as two of Google's earliest employees found a way to do what no one else had: make billions of dollars from Internet advertising. With this cash cow (until Google's IPO nobody other than Google management had any idea how lucrative the company's ad business was), Google was able to expand dramatically and take on other transformative projects: more efficient data centers, open-source cell phones, free Internet video (YouTube), cloud computing, digitizing books, and much more. The key to Google's success in all these businesses, Levy reveals, is its engineering mind-set and adoption of such Internet values as speed, openness, experimentation, and risk taking. After its unapologetically elitist approach to hiring, Google pampers its engineers \textemdash{} free food and dry cleaning, on-site doctors and masseuses \textemdash{} and gives them all the resources they need to succeed. Even today, with a workforce of more than 23,000, Larry Page signs off on every hire. But has Google lost its innovative edge? It stumbled badly in China\textemdash Levy discloses what went wrong and how Brin disagreed with his peers on the China strategy\textemdash and now with its newest initiative, social networking, Google is chasing a successful competitor for the first time. Some employees are leaving the company for smaller, nimbler start-ups. Can the company that famously decided not to be evil still compete? No other book has ever turned Google inside out as Levy does with In the Plex.},

It also focuses on understanding as a collective achievement, publicly displayed and interactively oriented to within the production and the monitoring of action. Its accountability is built through a plurality of displays, claiming and demonstrating understanding, thanks to the mobilization of linguistic and embodied resources at specific sequential positions. The paper discusses evidences of understanding as they are publicly displayed by the participants in interaction: It both offers a discussion of the ethnomethodological and conversation analytic literature, and an analysis an empirical case, focusing on the interplay of embodied and sequential features in the production and monitoring of understanding.},

This report examines the many sides of data science -- the technologies, the companies and the unique skill sets.The web is full of "data-driven apps." Almost any e-commerce application is a data-driven application. There's a database behind a web front end, and middleware that talks to a number of other databases and data services (credit card processing companies, banks, and so on). But merely using data isn't really what we mean by "data science." A data application acquires its value from the data itself, and creates more data as a result. It's not just an application with data; it's a data product. Data science enables the creation of data products.},

It provides the theoretical basis for many of today's machine learning algorithms. The theory helps to explore what permits to draw valid conclusions from empirical data. This chapter provides an overview of the key ideas and insights of statistical learning theory. The statistical learning theory begins with a class of hypotheses and uses empirical data to select one hypothesis from the class. If the data generating mechanism is benign, then it is observed that the difference between the training error and test error of a hypothesis from the class is small. The statistical learning theory generally avoids metaphysical statements about aspects of the true underlying dependency, and thus is precise by referring to the difference between training and test error. The chapter also describes some other variants of machine learning.},

For every approach, we have provided a brief description of the proposed knowledge discovery in databases (KDD) process, discussing about special features, outstanding advantages and disadvantages of every approach. Apart from that, a global comparative of all presented data mining approaches is provided, focusing on the different steps and tasks in which every approach interprets the whole KDD process. As a result of the comparison, we propose a new data mining and knowledge discovery process named refined data mining process for developing any kind of data mining and knowledge discovery project. The refined data mining process is built on specific steps taken from analyzed approaches.},

Which paint color is most likely to tell you that a used car is in good shape? How can officials identify the most dangerous New York City manholes before they explode? And how did Google searches predict the spread of the H1N1 flu outbreak?  The key to answering these questions, and many more, is big data. "Big data" refers to our burgeoning ability to crunch vast collections of information, analyze it instantly, and draw sometimes profoundly surprising conclusions from it. This emerging science can translate myriad phenomena--from the price of airline tickets to the text of millions of books--into searchable form, and uses our increasing computing power to unearth epiphanies that we never could have seen before. A revolution on par with the Internet or perhaps even the printing press, big data will change the way we think about business, health, politics, education, and innovation in the years to come. It also poses fresh threats, from the inevitable end of privacy as we know it to the prospect of being penalized for things we haven't even done yet, based on big data's ability to predict our future behavior.  In this brilliantly clear, often surprising work, two leading experts explain what big data is, how it will change our lives, and what we can do to protect ourselves from its hazards.

He calls on writings by John Tukey, Bill Cleveland, and Leo Breiman, among others, to remind us that statisticians have been dealing with data science for years, and encourages acceptance of the direction of the field while also ensuring that statistics is tightly integrated. As faculty at baccalaureate institutions (where the growth of undergraduate statistics programs has been dramatic), we are keen to ensure statistics has a place in data science and data science education.

Content: In the age of big data, data science (the knowledge of deriving meaningful outcomes from data) is an essential skill that should be equipped by software engineers. It can be used to predict useful information on new projects based on completed projects. This tutorial offers core insights about the state-of-the-art in this important field. What participants will learn: Before data science: this tutorial discusses the tasks needed to deploy machine-learning algorithms to organizations (Part 1: Organization Issues). During data science: from discretization to clustering to dichotomization and statistical analysis. And the rest: When local data is scarce, we show how to adapt data from other organizations to local problems. When privacy concerns block access, we show how to privatize data while still being able to mine it. When working with data of dubious quality, we show how to prune spurious information. When data or models seem too complex, we show how to simplify data mining results. When data is too scarce to support intricate models, we show methods for generating predictions. When the world changes, and old models need to be updated, we show how to handle those updates. When the effect is too complex for one model, we show how to reason across ensembles of models. Pre-requisites: This tutorial makes minimal use of maths of advanced algorithms and would be understandable by developers and technical managers.},

On a sunny August morning in 1927, Harold Black, a twenty-nine-year-old systems engineer, rode the Lackawanna ferry to work at the Bell Telephone Laboratories. Many Bell engineers lived in New Jersey, and on the early morning ferry rides across the Hudson to the Manhattan laboratories they frequently gathered on the forward deck. This morning Black stood alone, staring at the Statue of Liberty, and had an epiphany: "I suddenly realized that if I fed the amplifier output back to the input, in reverse phase, and kept the device from oscillating (singing, as we called it then), I would have exactly what I wanted: a means of canceling out the distortion in the output." As it happened, the New York Times that day contained a blank page, and Black sketched his idea, "a simple canonical diagram of a negative feedback amplifier plus the equations for the amplification with feedback." He rushed into work, asked a technician to wire up a prototype, and gave birth to a foundational circuit of modern electronics. This story has become enshrined as one of the central "flashes of insight" in electrical engineering in this century, periodically retold as an inspiration for engineers. A common textbook on control engineering reprints the story of Black's vision verbatim in the first chapter. At Bell Laboratories from 1927 to 1940, the legend goes, Black, Harry Nyquist, and Hendrik Bode laid the foundations of feedback control that engineers then applied to all types of closed-loop systems, from servomechanisms to thermostats, fire control systems to automatic computers. More than other contemporary narratives of control systems such as automatic pilots or servomechanisms, this story of feedback earned a place in engineering legend and college textbooks. It produced design methods and graphical techniques that carry their author's names (the Bode plot, the Nyquist diagram) and earned telephone engineering a claim to priority in feedback history. Feedback theory, moreover, formed the basis of cybernetics, systems theory, and a host of other post-World War II information sciences, so Black's invention is hailed as a foundation of the information age. Feedback is indeed a fundamental concept in twentieth-century technology, and the Bell Labs feedback theorists did lay critical foundations for it. But the origin myth effaces its sources. It skips over the inventors themselves and the ways in which their backgrounds and prior experience influenced their work. It reveals little about the concrete problems these men worked on when they produced their solutions. The story also removes feedback theory from its engineering culture, that of the telephone network between the world wars. Black's version also does not account for the relationship of his feedback amplifiers to prior traditions of governors and self-regulating machinery. Thus a reexamination of the sources is in order, retelling Black's legend not as a heroic tale but as the story of an engineer solving the technical problems of a particular place and time and trying to convince others to support his solutions. As it turns out, Black did not understand as much about feedback as he later recalled. To make his idea credible, he needed Nyquist's reformulation of the problem of stability and Bode's analysis outlining the tight constraints that a feedback amplifier had to meet. He also needed the Bell System. Negative-feedback amplifiers emerged from efforts to extend the telephone network across the continent, to increase the network's carrying capacity, and to make it work predictably in the face of changes in season, weather, and landscape -- from the context, that is, of building a large technical...},

  publisher = {{JHU Press}},
  abstract = {In a familiar story, the USS Monitor battled the CSS Virginia (the armored and refitted USS Merrimack) at Hampton Roads in March of 1862. In War, Technology, and Experience aboard the USS Monitor, David A. Mindell adds a new perspective to the story as he explores how mariners -- fighting "blindly" below the waterline -- lived and coped with the metal monster they called the "iron coffin." Mindell shows how the iron warship emerged as an idea and became practicable, how building it drew upon and forced changes in contemporary manufacturing technology, and how the vessel captured the nineteenth-century American popular and literary imaginations.Combining technical, personal, administrative, and literary analysis, Mindell examines the experience of the men aboard the Monitor and their reactions to the thrills and dangers that accompanied the new machine. The invention surrounded men with iron and threatened their heroism, their self-image as warriors, even their lives. Mindell also examines responses to this strange new warship by Nathaniel Hawthorne and Herman Melville, who prophetically saw in the Civil War a portent of the mechanized warfare of the future. The story of the Monitor shows how technology changes not only the tools but also the very experience of combat, generating effects that are still felt today in the era of "smart bombs" and pushbutton wars."We find new significance in the otherwise well-known history of the Monitor. It is no longer the story of the heroic inventor and his impenetrable weapon thrusting themselves upon a doubtful and conservative bureaucracy... It is no longer the story of a heroic battle and the machine's epic loss soon after. Rather it is a story of people experiencing new machinery, attempting to make sense of its thrills, constrictions, and politics, and sensing its power and impotence -- both in glory and frustration." -- from War, Technology, and Experience aboard the USS Monitor},

  abstract = {Although it is relatively easy to determine the efficacy of a new drug, it is difficult to establish its safety when administered to millions of patients with multifaceted diseases, co-morbidities, sensitivities, and multiple drug use. In Cardiac Safety of Noncardiac Drugs: Practical Guidelines for Clinical Research and Drug Development, basic and clinical researchers from industry and academia detail the preclinical, clinical, and regulatory principles currently used to assess the cardiac safety of new drugs from their effects on the electrocardiogram (ECG). The authors explain the parameters of cardiac safety at all stages of clinical research and drug development, including both the preclinical and pharmacogenomic aspects generally and the clinical methodologies and technical aspects for investigational drugs based on cardiac repolarization, as defined by the duration of the QTc interval. Additional chapters comprehensively review the application of electrocardiology in clinical research, demonstrating the fundamentals of ECG interpretation in clinical trials, the statistical analysis plans for ECG data obtained in formal clinical trials, and the practical interpretation of the results. Highlights include practical guidance on how to conduct a thorough ECG Trial in New Drug Development, how to use new ECG and web-based technology in clinical research, and how to follow the new FDA requirements for ECG submissions. Authoritative and up-to-date, Cardiac Safety of Noncardiac Drugs: Practical Guidelines for Clinical Research and Drug Development offers clinical researchers in industry and academia expert practical advice on establishing their product's cardiac safety, predicting regulatory actions, and getting it successfully to market.},

The volume and complexity of these rich data sets require new approaches and advanced tools to understand the information contained therein. No one can load this data on their own computer, most cannot even keep it at their institution, and worse, no platform exists that allows one to evaluate their models across the whole of the data. Simply having an extremely large volume of data available in one place is not sufficient; one must be able to make valid, rigorous, scientific comparisons across very different data sets from very different instrumentation. We propose a framework to directly address this which has the following components: a model-based computational platform, streamlined access to large volumes of data, and an educational and social platform for both researchers and the public.},

While the discussion takes empirical support  from a wide range, claims for the significance of logic and rules are  challenged throughout. Highlights of the discussion:    knowing is a matter of habits or dispositions that guide the  person's stream of consciousness;    rules of language have no  significance in language production and understanding, being  descriptions of linguistic styles;    statements that may be true  or false enter into ordinary linguistic activity, not as elements of  messages, but merely as summaries of situations, with a view to  action;    in computer programming the significance of logic,  proof, and formalized description, is incidental and subject to the  programmer's personality;    analysis of computer modelling of the  mental activity shows that in describing human knowing the computer is  irrelevant;    in accounting for the scholarly/scientific  activity, logic and rules are impotent;    a novel theory:  scholarship and science have coherent descriptions as their core.       The discussion addresses questions that are basic to advanced  applications of computers and to students of language and science.},

In 1978 he moved to Texas A\&M University as a Distinguished Professor, a post he currently holds. He has been a Fellow at Imperial College London, at IBM Systems Research Institute and at the Center for Advanced Study in the Behavioral Sciences at Stanford, as well as a Visiting Professor at the Sloan School of MIT, the Department of Statistics at Harvard and the Department of Biostatistics at Harvard. In 1959 he married Carol Tenowitz. They have two children and four grandchildren. Professor Parzen has authored or coauthored over 100 papers and 6 books. He has served on innumerable editorial boards and national committees, and has organized several influential conferences and workshops. He has directed the research of many graduate students and provided advice, encouragement and collaboration to students and colleagues around the world. To honor these contributions, he has been elected a Fellow of the American Statistical Association, of the Institute of Mathematical Statistics and of the American Association for the Advancement of Science. In 1994, he was awarded the prestigious Samuel S. Wilks Memorial Medal by the American Statistical Association.},

A library of target blip samples characterized by stochastic signals imbedded in noise has been generated on the computer for this purpose. The simulation technique employed is particularly useful in assessing not only the validity of the end results obtained from the theoretical model, such as detection efficiencies, false alarm rates, and position accuracies, as functions of the data processor and target parameters, but also the validity of intermediate assumptions on the nature of the various probability distributions and how they are transformed. The approach makes use of analog simulation techniques for data generation and digital simulation on a general purpose computer of the data processing schemes.},

  abstract = {Prior to 1985 the National Range had, for a number of years, serious and recurring mission support problems with the IBM 360 Telemetry Data Processing System due to equipment reliability and obsolescence of the system which was installed in 1968. These problems became particularly acute when higher data rate requirements and the need for reliable telemetry data processing dictated that prompt and unusual action was necessary if WSMR was to continue to provide telemetry data processing support. Realizing that the above cited problems of reliability and obsolescence would continue in detriment to the mission of WSMR, Department of Defense (DOD) and the nation, coupled with the loss of thousands of dollars in reimbursables due to WSMR's inability to support missile test requirements, the Systems Engineering Branch was tasked by the Director of National Range to lead a study, and propose and implement solutions to meet current and future requirements in telemetry data processing support. With the explosion in PCM data rates, it had become obvious that WSMR could not continue to upgrade existing systems and meet the demands of the future. More data parameters at higher data rates were being processed in PCM, FM, and PAM. Telemetry formats were becoming more complicated, such as embedded asynchronous subcomms and dynamic format changes. More real-time decisions had to be made for mission safety, verification of location, and mission success. WSMR needed a more versatile system that would synchronize, process and display higher data rates with more accuracy than it had at this time. This paper describes a historical perspective of steps WSMR has taken to satisfy present and future test vehicle telemetry data processing requirements.},

The utility of computer graphics has won the recognition of many researchers specializing in data analysis, and a variety of graphical representation methods have been proposed by them. From graphical representation, data analysts expect to obtain a firm grasp of the intrinsic structure of collected data by visualizing their features. The hardware environment bears closely upon free use of graphical representation as a means of data analysis. It deserves attention that the functional improvement of microcomputers and workstations has provided freedom of graphical representation and greater ease of graphics equipment operation. These graphical representation methods have some common features\textemdash (1) representing the features of multivariate data, (2) visual inspection of the relationship among variables, (3) observing data distribution, (4) projections based on data transformation and features selection, and (5) enhancement of intrinsic features in data.},

We argue that, in order to rise to the data-related challenges that the society is facing, data-science initiatives should ensure a renewal of traditional research methodologies that are still largely based on trial-error processes depending on the talent and insights of a single (or a restricted group of) researchers. It is our claim that design theories and methods can provide, at least to some extent, the much-needed framework. We will use a worldwide data-science challenge organized to study a technical problem in physics, namely the detection of Higgs boson, as a use case to demonstrate some of the ways in which design theory and methods can help in analyzing and shaping the innovation dynamics in such projects.},

Statistics journals have great difficulty accepting papers unlike those previously published. For statisticians with new big ideas a practical strategy is to publish them in many small applied studies which enables one to provide references to work of others. This essay outlines the many concepts, new theory, and important algorithms of our new culture of statistical science called LP MIXED DATA SCIENCE. It provides comprehensive solutions to problems of data analysis and nonparametric modeling of many variables that are continuous or discrete, which does not yet have a large literature. It develops a new modeling approach to nonparametric estimation of the multivariate copula density. We discuss the theory which we believe is very elegant (and can provide a framework for United Statistical Algorithms, for traditional Small Data methods and Big Data methods).},

The methods described are programmed and found successful in test cases. However, in the space available here only 'Chapter 1' of this work can be discussed. It outline the ideas:  how the basic general applied problems of statistical inference can be formulated as problems of estimation of distribution functions on the unit interval (or the unit hyper-cube), how such problems are more fruitfully treated as density estimation problems, and how to solve density estimation problems one can use the method which is the essence of the highly successful maximum likelihood method of parameter estimation: using a suitable information-theoretic divergence distance between densities, find the smooth density which is closest to a raw estimator of the density.},

The notes have been compiled on a brief time schedule and it will be apparent to the reader that the present version is incomplete and to some extent may lack uniformity in length, type of presentation, and technical detail in the various Sections. Nevertheless, there has been a demand for the notes from those who have seen them, and it is thought that they might serve a useful purpose if they were made available on a wider basis. It is believed that for the sake of expediency this goal is best achieved by making the material available now in its present unedited form instead of following the usual NACA editing procedures.},

As the speed of information growth exceeds Moore's Law at the beginning of this new century, excessive data is making great troubles to human beings. However, there are so much potential and highly useful values hidden in the huge volume of data. A new scientific paradigm is born as data-intensive scientific discovery (DISD), also known as Big Data problems. A large number of fields and sectors, ranging from economic and business activities to public administration, from national security to scientific researches in many areas, involve with Big Data problems. On the one hand, Big Data is extremely valuable to produce productivity in businesses and evolutionary breakthroughs in scientific disciplines, which give us a lot of opportunities to make great progresses in many fields. There is no doubt that the future competitions in business productivity and technologies will surely converge into the Big Data explorations. On the other hand, Big Data also arises with many challenges, such as difficulties in data capture, data storage, data analysis and data visualization. This paper is aimed to demonstrate a close-up view about Big Data, including Big Data applications, Big Data opportunities and challenges, as well as the state-of-the-art techniques and technologies we currently adopt to deal with the Big Data problems. We also discuss several underlying methodologies to handle the data deluge, for example, granular computing, cloud computing, bio-inspired computing, and quantum computing.},

After a brief review of salient features of Maring ethnography, formal characteristics of rituals making them suitable for communication and regulation functions are examined. From this discussion a concept of sanctity relating it to a problem inherent in symbolic communication is derived. The non-discussive basis of sanctity is then considered and the role of the sacred in the cybernetics of social and ecological systems is then discussed. Next it is suggested that the relationship between sanctity and authority changes with technological development. Finally, some tentative suggestions concerning the origins of the sacred are advanced.},

  abstract = {Interest in predictive analytics of big data has grown exponentially in the four years since the publication of Statistical and Machine-Learning Data Mining: Techniques for Better Predictive Modeling and Analysis of Big Data, Second Edition. In the third edition of this bestseller, the author has completely revised, reorganized, and repositioned the original chapters and produced 13 new chapters of creative and useful machine-learning data mining techniques. In sum, the 43 chapters of simple yet insightful quantitative techniques make this book unique in the field of data mining literature.  What is new in the Third Edition:   The current chapters have been completely rewritten.    The core content has been extended with strategies and methods for problems drawn from the top predictive analytics conference and statistical modeling workshops.   Adds thirteen new chapters including coverage of data science and its rise, market share estimation, share of wallet modeling without survey data, latent market segmentation, statistical regression modeling that deals with incomplete data, decile analysis assessment in terms of the predictive power of the data, and a user-friendly version of text mining, not requiring an advanced background in natural language processing (NLP).   Includes SAS subroutines which can be easily converted to other languages.  As in the previous edition, this book offers detailed background, discussion, and illustration of specific methods for solving the most commonly experienced problems in predictive modeling and analysis of big data. The author addresses each methodology and assigns its application to a specific type of problem. To better ground readers, the book provides an in-depth discussion of the basic methodologies of predictive modeling and analysis. While this type of overview has been attempted before, this approach offers a truly nitty-gritty, step-by-step method that both tyros and experts in the field can enjoy playing with.},

Observations, via embedding a researcher within the team, as well as more structured interviews and surveys, are documented. Recommendations to improve the current data science methodology within the company are also discussed. Overall, there had been little focus on the team's process methodology and the suggested process improvements would result in the company's data science projects having less risk and shorter timelines. Other big data teams might also benefit from reviewing and refining their work processes, but more work needs to be done to validate this assumption.},

Our research reports on a set of case studies, where researchers were embedded within Big Data teams. Since project methodologies will likely depend on the attributes of a Big Data effort, we focus our analysis on defining a framework to describe a Big Data project. We then use this framework to describe the organizations we studied and some of the socio-technical challenges linked to these newly defined project characteristics.},

Additional sociotechnical challenges include items such as how to define the project goals and how to ensure the project is effectively managed. This paper reports on a set of case studies where researchers were embedded within data science teams and where the researcher observations and analysis was focused on the attributes that can help describe data science projects and the challenges faced by the teams executing these projects, as opposed to the algorithms and technologies that were used to perform the analytics. Based on our case studies, we identified 14 characteristics that can help describe a data science project. We then used these characteristics to create a model that defines two key dimensions of the project. Finally, by clustering the projects within these two dimensions, we identified four types of data science projects, and based on the type of project, we identified some of the sociotechnical challenges that project teams should expect to encounter when executing data science projects.},

It relates to a serious attempt to develop machine methods for dealing with some of the perplexing problems that should, in all justice, be delegated to machines but which now seem to require the exercise of human intelligence. Two fundamentally different approaches to the problem are being explored, the one aimed at a complete understanding of the intellectual processes involved and the other aimed at duplicating the assumed specific behavior of the brain. The first approach concerns itself with such matters as search, pattern recognition, learning, planning, and induction; the second approach involves a study of the behavior of random nets. It is fair to conclude that artificial intelligence promises to reduce rather than to augment technological unemployment.},

We have defined the business understanding stage with defining the targeted questions, the set of lean data analysis sprints and a decision support stage. Each lean data analysis sprint contents of the task statement step, a step of data integration, a step of data analysis and the interpretation of the results. This approach allows to build data analysis software with iterative improvement quality of the results. Some case study have been suggested as examples of the proposed concept.},

  abstract = {TO COMPETE EFFECTIVELY IN today's marketplace, business managers must take timely advantage of high-return opportunities. Doing so requires that they be able to exploit the mountains of data their organizations generate and collect during daily operations. Yet, the difficulty of discerning the value in that information--of separating the wheat from the chaff--prevents many companies from fully capitalizing on the wealth of data at their disposal. For example, a bank account manager might want to identify a group of married, two-income, affluent customers and send them information about the bank's growth mutual funds, before a competing discount broker can lure them away. The information surely resides in the bank's computer system--and has probably been there in some form for years. The trick, of course, is to find an efficient way to extract and apply it. Data mining -- the process of extracting valid, previously unknown, comprehensible, and actionable information from large databases and using it to make crucial business decisions--currently performs this task for a growing range of businesses. After presenting an overview of current data-mining techniques, this article explores two particularly noteworthy applications of those techniques: market basket analysis and customer segmentation.},

  abstract = {The information era is the time when information is not only largely generated, but also vastly processed in order to extract and generated more information. The complex nature of modern living is represented by the various kind of data. Data can be in the forms of signals, images, texts, or manifolds resembling the horizon of observation. The task of the emerging data sciences are to extract information from the data, for people gain new insights of the complex world. The insights may came from the new way of the data representation, be it a visualizations, mapping, or other. The insights may also come from the implementation of mathematical analysis and or computational processing giving new insights of what the states of the nature represented by the data. Both ways implement the methodologies reducing the dimensionality of the data. The relations between the two functions, representation and analysis are the heart of how information in data is transformed mathematically and computationally into new information. The paper discusses some practices, along with various data coming from the social life in Indonesia to gain new insights about Indonesia in the emerging data sciences. The data sciences in Indonesia has made Indonesian Data Cartograms, Indonesian Celebrity Sentiment Mapping, Ethno-Clustering Maps, social media community detection, and a lot more to come, become possible. All of these are depicted as the exemplifications on how Data Science has become integral part of the technology bringing data closer to people.},

  abstract = {Between the 1960s and the end of the first decade of the twenty-first century computers have transformed from esoteric devices to ubiquitous tools in biological work. Archival research, ethnographic fieldwork, and interviews have been combined to explain and investigate the consequences of this shift. Early computers were used in the military and soon after for solving problems in the physical sciences. As such they were designed to solve specific kinds of problems: namely, problems of data management, simulations with large numbers of discrete data points, and statistical and stochastic problems. Computers also entailed and required the trappings of Big Science: big funding, multi-disciplinary collaboration, and careful management of laboratory spaces. The introduction of computers into the life sciences has imported both this style of knowledge production and these forms of practice and organization into the discipline of biology. Biology questions have become re-oriented from those that seek to understand individual genes or proteins towards those that seek to use the data management and statistical power of computer to understand large sets of biological objects. Meanwhile, biological practice has been transformed to organize and manage the interdisciplinary intersections between biologists, mathematicians, computer scientists, statisticians, and engineers who are all required in order to perform productive biological work. Moreover, the long strings of letters that represent protein and DNA sequences were especially susceptible to the kinds of data and statistical manipulations which could be performed on computers. The computer enabled the study of life 'out of sequence,' finding patterns in the apparently disordered spaces of genomes.},

Drawing on previous scholarship in anthropology and science and technology studies, I adopt the trope of the `affiliative object' to describe the relational dynamics of association (and disassociation) that characterize the identification of objects and persons. This perspective emphasizes the multiplicity of objects within the unfolding and uncertain trajectories of organizational life, as both problem and resource for organization members. The paper examines how `object-centered sociality' (Knorr-Cetina, 1997) is enacted as a strategic, but also contingent, resource in the alignment of professional identities and organizational positionings.},

  abstract = {"Data analysis'' instead of ``statistics'' is a name that allows us to use probability where it is needed and avoid it when we should. Data analysis has to analyze real data. Most real data calls for data investigation, while almost all statistical theory is concerned with data processing. This can be borne, in part because large segments of data investigation are, by themselves, data processing. Summarizing a batch of 20 numbers is a convenient paradigm for more complex aims in data analysis. A particular summary, highly competitive among those known and known about in August 1971, is a hybrid between two moderately complex summaries. Data investigation comes in three stages: exploratory data analysis (no probability), rough confirmatory data analysis (sign test procedures and the like), mustering and borrowing strength (the best of modern robust techniques, and an art of knowing when to stop). Exploratory data analysis can be improved by being made more resistant, either with medians or with fancier summaries. Rough confirmatory data analysis can be improved by facing up to the issues surrounding the choice of what is to be confirmed or disaffirmed. Borrowing strength is imbedded in our classical procedures, though we often forget this. Mustering strength calls for the best in robust summaries we can supply. The sampling behavior of such a summary as the hybrid mentioned above is not going to be learned through the mathematics of certainty, at least as we know it today, especially if we are realistic about the diversity of non-Gaussian situations that are studied. The mathematics of simulation, inevitably involving the mathematically sound ``swindles'' of Monte Carlo, will be our trust and reliance. I illustrate results for a few summaries, including the hybrid mentioned above. Bayesian techniques are still a problem to the author, mainly because there seems to be no agreement on what their essence is. From my own point of view, some statements of their essence are wholly acceptable and others are equally unacceptable. The use of exogeneous information in analyzing a given body of data is a very different thing (a) depending on sample size and (b) depending on just how the exogeneous information is used. It would be a very fine thing if the questions that practical data analysis has to have answered could be answered by the mathematics of certainty. For my own part, I see no escape, for the next decade or so at least, from a dependence on the mathematics of simulation, in which we should heed von Neumann's aphorism as much as we can.},

Very little attention will be given to how the results can be calculated--after all, there are books about that (e.g., Miller, 1966, 1981; Hochberg and Tamhane, 1987).},

  abstract = {Statistical learning theory was introduced in the late 1960's. Until the 1990's it was a purely theoretical analysis of the problem of function estimation from a given collection of data. In the middle of the 1990's new types of learning algorithms (called support vector machines) based on the developed theory were proposed. This made statistical learning theory not only a tool for the theoretical analysis but also a tool for creating practical algorithms for estimating multidimensional functions. This article presents a very general overview of statistical learning theory including both theoretical and algorithmic aspects of the theory. The goal of this overview is to demonstrate how the abstract learning theory established conditions for generalization which are more general than those discussed in classical statistical paradigms and how the understanding of these conditions inspired new algorithmic approaches to function estimation problems.},

Conventional statistical and econometric techniques such as regression often work well, but there are issues unique to big datasets that may require different tools. First, the sheer size of the data involved may require more powerful data manipulation tools. Second, we may have more potential predictors than appropriate for estimation, so we need to do some kind of variable selection. Third, large datasets may allow for more flexible relationships than simple linear models. Machine learning techniques such as decision trees, support vector machines, neural nets, deep learning, and so on may allow for more effective ways to model complex relationships. In this essay, I will describe a few of these tools for manipulating and analyzing big data. I believe that these methods have a lot to offer and should be more widely known and used by economists.},

All professions require highly specialised education and training, an ethical code, self-regulation by a professional association and certification and licensing. Data science should become a profession for the same reasons medicine and law became professions: each requires practitioners to have a specialised body of knowledge, a code of conduct and self-regulation by knowledgeable professionals to assure competency and protect the public.

The purpose of this epidemiologic investigation is to determine whether long-term health effects exist and can be attributed to occupational exposure to herbicides. This study uses a matched cohort design in a nonconcurrent prospective setting, incorporating mortality, morbidity, and follow-up studies. This paper presents the results of the analysis of health information on 2706 Ranch Handers and comparison individuals obtained by questionnaire and 2269 Ranch Handers and comparison individuals undergoing an extensive physical examination. There is insufficient evidence to support a cause and effect relationship between herbicide exposure and adverse health in the Ranch Hand group at this time. The study has disclosed numerous medical findings, mostly of a minor or undetermined nature, that require detailed follow-up.},

(ii) does the sequence of parameter estimates generated by EM converge? Several convergence results are obtained under conditions that are applicable to many practical situations. Two useful special cases are: (a) if the unobserved complete-data specification can be described by a curved exponential family with compact parameter space, all the limit points of any EM sequence are stationary points of the likelihood function; (b) if the likelihood function is unimodal and a certain differentiability condition is satisfied, then any EM sequence converges to the unique maximum likelihood estimate. A list of key properties of the algorithm is included.},

  abstract = {Data science is a discipline that provides principles, methodology, and guidelines for the analysis of data for tools, values, or insights. Driven by a huge workforce demand, many academic institutions have started to offer degrees in data science, with many at the graduate, and a few at the undergraduate level. Curricula may differ at different institutions, because of varying levels of faculty expertise, and different disciplines (such as mathematics, computer science, and business) in developing the curriculum. The University of Massachusetts Dartmouth started offering degree programs in data science from Fall 2015, at both the undergraduate and the graduate level. Quite a few articles have been published that deal with graduate data science courses, much less so dealing with undergraduate ones. Our discussion will focus on undergraduate course structure and function, and specifically, a first course in data science. Our design of this course centers around a concept called the data science life cycle. That is, we view tasks or steps in the practice of data science as forming a process, consisting of states that indicate how it comes into life, how different tasks in data science depend on or interact with others until the birth of a data product or a conclusion. Naturally, different pieces of the data science life cycle then form individual parts of the course. Details of each piece are filled up by concepts, techniques, or skills that are popular in industry. Consequently, the design of our course is both ``principled'' and practical. A significant feature of our course philosophy is that, in line with activity theory, the course is based on the use of tools to transform real data to answer strongly motivated questions related to the data.},

Some data are the records related to culture and society, and others are the descriptions of phenomena of universe and life. The large scale of data is rapidly generated and stored in computer systems, which is called data explosion. Data explosion forms data nature in computer systems. To explore data nature, new theories and methods are required. In this paper, we present the concept of data nature and introduce the problems arising from data nature, and then we define a new discipline named dataology (also called data science or science of data), which is an umbrella of theories, methods and technologies for studying data nature. The research issues and framework of dataology are proposed.},
