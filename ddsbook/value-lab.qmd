# Labs Rubric - Guess Who

DS 1001 - Spring 2023 - Professors Wright and Alonzi Due: End of lab period (or later that day) Submission format: Word doc or PDF summarizing your findings

Individual Assignment

General Descripition: This lab is design for you to reflect on the process used for winning the game Guess Who. Students should work in teams to play the game and take notes on the processes that work best for quickly guessing the opponents card. This will likely include the creation of a tree based decision diagram, a example will be provided in class.

Preparatory Assignments - None

Why am I doing this? In order to allow you to reflect on how data is used to generated decision/predictive algorithms and what issues could arise as a result. Work to incorporate the materials you've been exposed to up to this point as you work through the lab.

What am I going to do? You are the machine and you are working through a interactive process of training yourself to find the optimal list of yes/no questions for any given card. Play the game as many times as necessary to construct a list of top five questions.

Answer these questions:

1.  In this situation what is the dataset and what is the algorithm?
2.  Are there cards that are easier to identify, why?
3.  This is just a game, but given the material you've been exposed to what concerns do you have?

Tips for success:

-   Don't worry about winning

-   Work as a team with your group

-   Try document the process used right at the beginning of the lab

How will I know I have succeeded
