However, almost every organization has a unique way of defining roles in data science and associated skills and knowledge. This has resulted in a confusing industry landscape for employers, academic and training institutions, and existing and aspiring data science professionals. This article is the first in a series authored by Initiative for Analytics and Data Science Standards ({IADSS}). We review the history of data science, which we trace back to 1974, and the emergence of data science as a profession in the industry, followed by a classification of knowledge and skills commonly associated with data science professionals, pointing to a lack of detailed and consistent treatment of the topic. We then present a Data Science Knowledge Framework, that we believe can support industry standardization and building measurement and assessment methodologies for data science professionals.},

The idea of a frequency curve, for example, evidently implies an infinite hypothetical population distributed in a definite manner; but equally evidently the idea of an infinite hypothetical population requires a more precise logical specification than is contained in that phrase. The same may be said of the intimately connected idea of random sampling. These ideas have grown up in the minds of practical statisticians and lie at the basis especially of recent work; there can be no question of their pragmatic value. It was no part of my original intention to deal with the logical bases of these ideas, but some comments which Dr Burnside has kindly made have convinced me that it may be desirable to set out for criticism the manner in which I believe the logical foundations of these ideas may be established.},

How the rate of transmission of this information over a system is limited by the distortion resulting from storage of energy is discussed from the transient viewpoint. The relation between the transient and steady state viewpoints is reviewed. It is shown that when the storage of energy is used to restrict the steady state transmission to a limited range of frequencies the amount of information that can be transmitted is proportional to the product of the width of the frequency-range by the time it is available. Several illustrations of the application of this principle to practical systems are included. In the case of picture transmission and television the spacial variation of intensity is analyzed by a steady state method analogous to that commonly used for variations with time.},

	shorttitle = {The Gene},
	abstract = {"The story of the gene begins in earnest in an obscure Augustinian abbey in Moravia in 1856 where Gregor Mendel, a monk working with pea plants, stumbles on the idea of a "unit of heredity." It intersects with Darwin's theory of evolution, and collides with the horrors of Nazi eugenics in the 1940s. The gene transforms postwar biology. It invades discourses concerning race and identity and provides startling answers to some of the most potent questions coursing through our political and cultural realms. It reorganizes our understanding of sexuality, gender identity, sexual orientation, temperament, choice, and free will, thus raising the most urgent questions affecting our personal realms. Above all, the story of the gene is driven by human ingenuity and obsessive minds -- from Gregor Mendel and Charles Darwin to Francis Crick, James Watson, and Rosalind Franklin to the thousands of scientists working today to understand the code of codes. Author of the Pulitzer Prize-winning bestseller The Emperor of All Maladies, Mukherjee draws on his scientific knowledge and research to describe the magisterial history of a scientific idea. Woven through The Gene is the story of Mukherjee's own family and its recurring pattern of schizophrenia, a haunting reminder that the science of genetics is not confined to the laboratory but is vitally relevant to everyday lives. The moral complexity of genetics reverberates even more urgently today as we learn to "read" and "write" the human genome--unleashing the potential to change the fates and identities of our children and our children's children"--Jacket., "Magnificent, beautifully written, and riveting, Siddhartha Mukherjee's The Gene: An Intimate History illuminates the quest to decipher the master-code of instructions that makes and defines humans; that governs our form, function, and fate; and that determines the future of our children"--Jacket.},

	abstract = {The study of data systems as information systems put into focus the role of data as representations of information in the sense of knowledge about some slice of the world. This information system-view—or infological view—made it clear that the data alone cannot “carry” information. They can only, at best, give rise to information in the minds of people and only in those people who hold a suitable frame-of-reference or world view, or “receiving structure”, in their mind. Thus the infological perspective had to be widened successively from a concern merely with information representation, structuring, and exploitation to the study of social, sociopsychological and socio-linguistical aspects and of “object system”, job design and other socio-technical issues. The term “user view” is employed widely in recent data base work. The use of the term “user view” suggests such an “infological” perspective. However, a closer look at how the term is actually used indicates a much more delimited interpretation which focuses on representational aspects and processing. This is also made explicit, to some degree, by the usual formulation “user view of the data” rather than, for instance, “user view of the world”. In this paper a brief study is made of the two aspects of user views, 1.(i) the infological/conceptual aspect, which is concerned with how conception relates to data and information, and to reality, and2.(ii) the “datalogical” aspect, which is concerned with the selection of data from a data base and the rearrangement of them to suit a “user view” of the data (as seen from the application programmer). The infological aspect is illustrated through a discussion of some of my own earlier results which are here brought together. The datalogical aspect is exemplified by some quotations from the most recent data base literature, as well as by some earlier results of my own. The term “user view” is frequently used in the datalogical sense whereas the infological or information-system-theoretical studies often have addressed questions that have to do with the infological/conceptual aspects of “user views”, without employing that term. In this paper some aspects of the problem of infological/conceptual user views are treated with a view to gain understanding of how both aspects of user views affect the design and use of information systems and data bases. Illustrations are taken from the author's own earlier work, for three reasons: 1.(i) they were most easily available,2.ii) they are directly associated with the problem at hand, and3.(iii) they have earlier been scattered over several works and it was useful, for the purpose of the present discussion, to bring them together.},

	abstract = {The overview presented covers a wide spectrum of aspects on information systems. Consequently, we had to be very brief and for detailed definitions and discussions we must refer the interested reader to the underlying literature. We have described how information systems present complex problems to their designers and we argued that it is hardly possible for any one individual to acquire (and continuously update) sufficient skill over the whole spectrum of problems. It is shown how the partitioning of the design task into two major areas, the infological or behavioral area on the one hand and the datalogical and computer technology oriented area on the other hand, makes it possible to combine the skills of two (or more) groups of people. In addition, the users are to be directly involved in the (infological part of) design. Development in the “infological area”, as surveyed in the paper, has brought us to the situation where it is possible to apply a documentation technique that is computer independent and intelligible to the lay users in its infological parts and yet is precise enough to the data and program design stage. Actual research problems in the infological area are associated with how one could develop the understanding and the motivation of the users so that they can better exploit the possibility to control the design process that is now offered to them. Such research is not covered by the paper. Development in the “datalogical area”, as presented has increased the possibilities for using computers as aid to the designers and to base the design on more system-wide information. A research field which is presently of high interest, but not presented in the paper, is the development of more formalized methods for handling the interface between the infological and the datalogical design stages. Such research is presently making promising progress in combining recent results from “structured programming” and ”structured information analysis”.},

	abstract = {Data Science is a complex and evolving field, but most agree that it can be defined as a combination of expertise drawn from three broad areascomputer science and technology, math and statistics, and domain knowledge -- with the purpose of extracting knowledge and value from data. Beyond this, the field is often defined as a series of practical activities ranging from the cleaning and wrangling of data, to its analysis and use to infer models, to the visual and rhetorical representation of results to stakeholders and decision-makers. This essay proposes a model of data science that goes beyond laundry-list definitions to get at the specific nature of data science and help distinguish it from adjacent fields such as computer science and statistics. We define data science as an interdisciplinary field comprising four broad areas of expertise: value, design, systems, and analytics. A fifth area, practice, integrates the other four in specific contexts of domain knowledge. We call this the 4+1 model of data science. Together, these areas belong to every data science project, even if they are often unconnected and siloed in the academy.},

	doi = {10.48550/arXiv.2311.03292},
	abstract = {Consensus on the definition of data science remains low despite the widespread establishment of academic programs in the field and continued demand for data scientists in industry. Definitions range from rebranded statistics to data-driven science to the science of data to simply the application of machine learning to so-called big data to solve real-world problems. Current efforts to trace the history of the field in order to clarify its definition, such as Donoho's "50 Years of Data Science" (Donoho 2017), tend to focus on a short period when a small group of statisticians adopted the term in an unsuccessful attempt to rebrand their field in the face of the overshadowing effects of computational statistics and data mining. Using textual evidence from primary sources, this essay traces the history of the term to the 1960s, when it was first used by the {US} Air Force in a surprisingly similar way to its current usage, to 2012, the year that Harvard Business Review published the enormously influential article "Data Scientist: The Sexiest Job of the 21st Century" (Davenport and Patil 2012), while the American Statistical Association acknowledged a profound disconnect between statistics and data science. Among the themes that emerge from this review are (1) the long-standing opposition between data analysts and data miners that continues to animate the field, (2) an established definition of the term as the practice of managing and processing scientific data that has been occluded by recent usage, and (3) the phenomenon of data impedance -- the disproportion between surplus data, indexed by phrases like data deluge and big data, and the limitations of computational machinery and methods to process them. This persistent condition appears to have motivated the use of the term and the field itself since its beginnings.},

It is the least biased estimate possible on the given information; i.e., it is maximally noncommittal with regard to missing information. If one considers statistical mechanics as a form of statistical inference rather than as a physical theory, it is found that the usual computational rules, starting with the determination of the partition function, are an immediate consequence of the maximum-entropy principle. In the resulting "subjective statistical mechanics," the usual rules are thus justified independently of any physical argument, and in particular independently of experimental verification; whether or not the results agree with experiment, they still represent the best estimates that could have been made on the basis of the information available.},

This line of thinking highlights the existence of two independent but coupled sets of laws: Information dynamics and energy dynamics. The distinction helps shed light on certain foundational questions in statistical mechanics. For example, the confusion surrounding previous “derivations” of the second law from energy dynamics can be resolved by noting that such derivations incorporate one or more assumptions that correspond to the loss of information. In this paper we further develop and explore the perspective in which the second law is fundamentally a law of information dynamics.},
