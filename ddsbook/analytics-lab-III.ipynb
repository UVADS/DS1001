This notebook will walk you through a shorten series of steps necessary to prepare the data for kNN. You will then be asked to interpret and manipulate the model features with goal of better understanding how kNN works. "

The variables are all continuous and the target variable is a categorical variable with 3 levels. The goal of this lab is to build a kNN model that can predict the target variable based on the 15 predictor variables."
