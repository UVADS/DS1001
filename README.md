## A Little Bit About the Course
This is a survey course about the emerging field of Data Science. The School of Data Science at UVA has pioneered a new approach to Data Science that goes beyond the analytical computational aspect of Data Science and also encompasses the human element necessary to achieve real and ethical effect in today's data driven world. This course will focus on the fundamental concepts of each aspect of Data Science as expressed in the Virginia Model of Data Science ([link](https://ontoligent.github.io/four-plus-one-model/)). 

## What you’ll learn along the way
We will spend the majority of the semester focusing on the major aspecs of Data Science: Design, Value, Systems, and Analytics. We will finish the semester with time for putting these concepts into practice and understanding the Data Science pipeline. Each of these components has learning objectives detailed below but the highest level objective is that you will be able to:

* Prime Learning Objective: Define Data Science and explain it to friends and family // Be able to describe the field of Data Science and its emerging sub-fields
* Secondary Objective: Identify how you see yourself in the field

In each of the areas we will specifically focus on:
* Design
  * Theme: Storytelling -- What do I leave in and what do I leave out?
  * LO: Observe the world around you and record your observations in a systematic way (aka create a data set)
  * LO: Reflect on your data set and transform it into a medium for efficient communication to other humans

* Value
  * Theme: With great power comes great responsibility
  * LO: Be able to reflect on and articulate the benefits and concerns of data driven decisions
  * LO: Describe scenerios that allow for human centered data science

* Systems
  * Theme: Scaling -- What scale is necessary?
  * LO: Identify the hardware and software components of a computer and describe their function
  * LO: Describe the different scales of computer operation

* Analytics
  * Theme: Analyzing -- Garbage in, Garbage out
  * LO: Describe the ecosystem of data models 
  * LO: Articulate a typical algorithym life cycle 

The course will move rather quickly and can be demanding at times. However, if we all work together to support each other you’ll be amazed how much you learn at the end of the semester!

## How You’ll Know You Are Learning (Assessments)
Every assignment in this class falls into one of 5 categories outlined below. Each assignment has a rubric to indicate the purpose, task, and criteria for the assignment.

The 5 assignment categories:
1. Labs - there is a lab section for this course and every student is expected to enroll and complete the lab assignments. The definintion of "lab" is loose as the assignments performed in the lab sections vary. The goal is for all of this work to be completable within the class lab period.
2. "Read" and Review - every week supplemental material will be posted to enhance the in class activities. This is not just reading but can also include watching short videos. A short review of the key points is then submitted as the assignment deliverable.
3. Case Study Extensions - During the semesters case studies will be presented. This assignment type involves going beyond the initial parameter of the case study and exploring some of the more advanced points.
4. "Look ahead" - These assignments are designed to allow students to advance their mastery of topics further. The incorperate material from course typically taken by 2nd and 3rd year students.
5. Final Essay - This assignment is the students opportunity to synthesize the semester and show mastery of the primary learning objective "define data science". The higher bundles require a more complex essay which includes a discussion of personal career paths in data science and ultimately discussing next steps and the future of data science.

## Tech Stack (Course Delivery Tools)
There are several technological tools used in this class:

* email: Official communication from UVA is sent via the class email
* canvas: The offical Learning Management System for this course is canvas, all assignments are managed through canvas **including lab assignments**.
* discord: The official-unoffical course chat channel **[Discord Invite Click](https://discord.gg/PGaPcMHp)**

## A few Policies that will Govern the Class

Grading Policies: This course uses the specifications grading system as explained in **Specifications Grading** By Linda Nilson. For details [see this page](grading.md).

University of Virginia Honor System: All work should be pledged in the spirit of the Honor System at the University of Virginia. The instructor will indicate which assignments and activities are to be done individually and which permit collaboration. The following pledge should be written out at the end of all quizzes, examinations, individual assignments, and papers:  “I pledge that I have neither given nor received help on this examination (quiz, assignment, etc.)”.  The pledge must be signed by the student. For more information, visit www.virginia.edu/honor.


Special Needs:  The University of Virginia accommodates students with disabilities. Any SCPS student with a disability who needs accommodation (e.g., in arrangements for seating, extended time for examinations, or note-taking, etc.), should contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) and provide them with appropriate medical or psychological documentation of his/her condition. Once accommodations are approved, just follow up with me concerning any logistics and implementation of accommodations.  Please try to make accommodations for test-taking at least 14 business days in advance of the date of the test(s). Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the SDAC: 434-243-5180/Voice, 434-465-6579/Video Phone, 434-243-5188/Fax.
