## A Little Bit About the Course
This is a survey course about the emerging field of Data Science. The School of Data Science at UVA has pioneered a new approach to Data Science that goes beyond the analytical computational aspect of Data Science and also encompasses the human element necessary to achieve real and ethical effect in today's data driven world. This course will focus on the fundamental concepts of each aspect of Data Science as expressed in the Virginia Model of Data Science [https://ontoligent.github.io/four-plus-one-model/](link). 

## What you’ll learn along the way
We will spend the majority of the semester focusing on the major aspecs of Data Science: Design, Value, Systems, and Analytics. We will finish the semester with time for putting these concepts into practice and understanding the Data Science pipeline. Each of these components has learning objectives detailed below but the highest level objective is that you will be able to:

* Prime Learning Objective: Define Data Science and explain it to friends and family

In each of the areas we will specifically focus on:
* Design
  * Theme: Storytelling -- what to leave in and what to leave out
  * LO: Observe the world around you and record your observations in a systematic way (aka create a data set)
  * LO: Reflect on your data set and transform it into a medium for efficient communication to other humans

* Value
  * Theme: 
  * LO: 
  * LO: 

* Systems
  * Theme:
  * LO: 
  * LO:

* Analytics
  * Theme: Analyzing -- Garbage in, Garbage out
  * LO: 
  * LO: 


...... Specific learning objectives are below:

    Be able to describe the field of Data Science and its emerging sub-fields
   

The course will move rather quickly and can be demanding at times. However, if we all work together to support each other you’ll be amazed how much you learn at the end of the semester!

## A few Policies that will Govern the Class

Grading Policies: This course uses the specifications grading system as explained in **Specifications Grading** By Linda Nilson. For details [see this page](grading.md).

University of Virginia Honor System: All work should be pledged in the spirit of the Honor System at the University of Virginia. The instructor will indicate which assignments and activities are to be done individually and which permit collaboration. The following pledge should be written out at the end of all quizzes, examinations, individual assignments, and papers:  “I pledge that I have neither given nor received help on this examination (quiz, assignment, etc.)”.  The pledge must be signed by the student. For more information, visit www.virginia.edu/honor.


Special Needs:  The University of Virginia accommodates students with disabilities. Any SCPS student with a disability who needs accommodation (e.g., in arrangements for seating, extended time for examinations, or note-taking, etc.), should contact the Student Disability Access Center (SDAC) and provide them with appropriate medical or psychological documentation of his/her condition. Once accommodations are approved, just follow up with me concerning any logistics and implementation of accommodations.  Please try to make accommodations for test-taking at least 14 business days in advance of the date of the test(s). Students with disabilities are encouraged to contact the SDAC: 434-243-5180/Voice, 434-465-6579/Video Phone, 434-243-5188/Fax.
